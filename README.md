#  House Price Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts residential property prices.

## The Problem

Predicting house prices is difficult — value depends on dozens of interacting factors like size, location, age, and number of rooms, and the relationships are rarely linear. This project builds a data-driven regression model that learns patterns from real property data to estimate sale prices.

The project runs across two tracks:
- **Main project** — Melbourne property prices using `melb_data.csv` (13,580 listings, target: `Price` in AUD)
- **Kaggle exercises** — Ames, Iowa home prices using the [Kaggle Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course) dataset (79 features, ~1,460 training samples)

## Why It Matters

Housing is one of the largest financial decisions most people make. A reliable prediction model gives buyers a benchmark for fair pricing, helps sellers set competitive prices, and gives lenders a consistent way to assess collateral — without waiting for a manual appraisal. From a learning standpoint, this problem covers nearly every fundamental ML skill: cleaning, encoding, imputing, training, tuning, and evaluating.

## Approach

**Main Project Pipeline:**
1. Load and explore `melb_data.csv` — 13,580 rows, 21 columns, price range $85K–$9M
2. Drop rows with missing values in numeric features → 6,830 clean rows remain
3. Auto-select 12 numeric features: `Rooms`, `Distance`, `BuildingArea`, `YearBuilt`, `Landsize`, `Bathroom`, `Car`, `Postcode`, `Bedroom2`, `Lattitude`, `Longtitude`, `Propertycount`
4. 80/20 train-validation split (`random_state=1`)
5. Train Decision Tree (baseline + tuned) and Random Forest (100 trees + cross-validated)
6. Evaluate on MAE, RMSE, and R²

**Kaggle Exercises — what each one covered:**

| Exercise | Topic |
|---|---|
| Introduction | Comparing 5 Random Forest variants, selecting best |
| Missing Values | Drop columns vs. mean imputation |
| Categorical Variables | Drop vs. ordinal encoding vs. one-hot encoding |
| Pipelines | Bundling preprocessing + model into `sklearn.Pipeline` |
| XGBoost | Gradient boosting, tuning `n_estimators` and `learning_rate` |
| Data Leakage | Identifying target leakage and train-test contamination |

## Key Decisions

- **Dropped rows over imputing** — `BuildingArea` was the most important feature (37% of RF importance), so filling 6,450 missing values with a mean would have corrupted the model's primary signal
- **Ordinal encoding beat one-hot** — Empirically produced the lowest MAE (17,098) vs. dropping (17,837) or one-hot (17,525) on the Ames dataset
- **n_estimators = 150** — Cross-validation showed no meaningful gain beyond 150 trees; MAE plateaued at $211,795
- **Mean imputation over constant** — More statistically appropriate, reduced MAE from 17,614 → 17,612 in the pipeline exercise

## Results

### Melbourne Housing

| Model | MAE |
|---|---|
| Decision Tree (baseline) | $229,232 |
| Decision Tree (tuned, `max_leaf_nodes=500`) | $208,956 |
| **Random Forest (100 trees)** | **$173,738** |

R² Score: **0.7937** — Mean Percentage Error: **16.14%**

Top features: `BuildingArea` (0.375) › `Distance` (0.156) › `Postcode` (0.110) › `YearBuilt` (0.101)

### Kaggle — Ames, Iowa

| Approach | MAE |
|---|---|
| Ordinal encoding + Random Forest | 17,098 |
| Pipeline (mean imputation + one-hot + RF) | 17,612 |
| **XGBoost (tuned)** | **17,032** |

## What I Learned

- Data preparation matters more than algorithm choice — cleaning alone took more time than modelling
- Feature importances matched real-world logic: size and location dominate Melbourne prices
- Empirical results beat assumptions — imputation didn't beat dropping, and ordinal beat one-hot, contrary to expectation
- Pipelines are essential for consistent, deployment-safe preprocessing
- Data leakage can make a model look perfect in training while being useless in production
